# Properties

To make the process of property creation easier, we can look at the system from different points of view. In our case, these will be our types of properties.

[Certora](https://github.com/Certora/Tutorials/blob/master/06.Lesson_ThinkingProperties/Categorizing_Properties.pdf) splits properties into 5 main types:

- Valid States
- State Transitions
- Variable Transitions
- High-Level Properties
- Unit Tests

| Property                                                                                                                                                                                        | Type              | Risk   | Tested |
| ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------- | ------ | ------ |
| The Multisig (VaultController) only have access to 50% of the weekly yield generated on the yield source, hence the Vault can only lose 50% of the yield generated by Lido                      | Unit Tests        | High   |        |
| The Multisig (VaultController) can not withdraw on behalf of other users                                                                                                                        | Unit Tests        | High   |

| At the Deposits Processing Window, newly deposited funds are moved from the vault to the Yield Source                                                                                           | State Transitions | Medium |

| A user will always withdraw more or equal to what they have deposited, unless there are withdraw fees, negative rebasing events or rounding errors                                              | High-Level        | High   | ✅     |
