 * @title RebasingWrapper
 * @author Pods Finance
 * @notice This is a fork from Lido's stETH code. The idea here is to create a wrapper
 * that modifies the behavior of exchange rate tokens (think wstETH) to be rebasing tokens
 * (think stETH). Exchange rate and rebasing tokens are very similar, as both are yield
 * bearing tokens, and they have subtle differences on how they store and display the yield.
 * Exchange rate tokens have a static balance for each account, and when they accrue value
 * they do it by changing the rate in which they are swapped to the underlying asset.
 * Rebasing tokens, on the other hand, have a static rate in which they are swapped to the
 * underlying asset, and when they accrue value they do it by changing the balance of each
 * account.
 * This wrapper is intended to be used with Exchange Rate tokens as underlying tokens, and
 * to provide a rebasing behavior to them.
